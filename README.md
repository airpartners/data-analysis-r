# Air Quality Data Analysis in R

This repository houses our code for analyzing qir quality data taken from condensation particle counter (CPC) sensors in East Boston. 
Note that this repository is *different* from the analysis code for data from the network of air quality sensors distributed in East Boston; this is
for our two CPC sensor boxes (the repo for the sensor box hardware can be found ![here](https://github.com/airpartners/logger)).

The ![wiki](https://github.com/airpartners/data-analysis-r/wiki) contains instructions for setting up your RStudio environment and running the code.
